OOP Projects for PClub project Game of Blocks.
I have attached two projects, one self project I had done before and the second project being a Snake & Ladder game that I creted specifically for this task. I have attached both because I had not used constructors in my old project. I also didn't find the need to use inheritance in any of these two projects though I can implement it.
